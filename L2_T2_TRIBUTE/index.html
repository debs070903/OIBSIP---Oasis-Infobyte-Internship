      <h1>The Living Legend</h1>
      <p>
        Cristiano Ronaldo, often hailed as "The Living Legend," was born on
        February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal. His journey from humble
        beginnings to global football stardom is a testament to his exceptional
        talent, relentless work ethic, and unwavering determination.
      </p>
      <div id="more-content" class="hide">
        <p>
          Ronaldo's professional career began at Sporting CP, where his
          impressive performances caught the attention of Manchester United. In
          2003, at the age of 18, he signed with the English club. Under the
          guidance of Sir Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo honed his skills, becoming a
          formidable winger known for his incredible speed, agility, and
          goal-scoring ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          During his six years at Manchester United, he won three Premier League
          titles, a UEFA Champions League trophy, and the FIFA Club World Cup,
          among other honors. His extraordinary performances earned him the
          first of many Ballon d'Or awards in 2008. In 2009, Ronaldo made a
          high-profile move to Real Madrid for a then-record transfer fee. At
          Real Madrid, he transformed into one of the greatest goal scorers in
          the sport's history. Over nine seasons, he scored an astonishing 450
          goals in 438 appearances, helping the club secure four Champions
          League titles, two La Liga titles, and numerous other trophies. His
          rivalry with Lionel Messi during this period became a defining aspect
          of modern football, captivating fans worldwide. In 2018, Ronaldo
          transferred to Juventus, continuing to display his remarkable
          goal-scoring prowess and contributing to the team's domestic
          successes. His influence extended beyond the pitch, with Ronaldo
          becoming a global brand and one of the most marketable athletes in the
          world. His disciplined lifestyle, rigorous training routines, and
          philanthropic efforts further cemented his status as a role model for
          aspiring athletes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, Ronaldo made a sensational return to Manchester United,
          continuing to break records and defy age-related expectations. His
          enduring legacy is marked not only by his numerous individual awards,
          including multiple Ballon d'Or titles, but also by his impact on and
          off the field. As "The Living Legend," Cristiano Ronaldo's story is
          one of extraordinary talent, perseverance, and an unrelenting pursuit
          of excellence, making him a true icon in the world of football.
